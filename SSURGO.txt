SSURGO data processing notes.

1. Import SSURGO component data by state.
2. Delete nonsoil and unknown data, and soils with organic matter > 50%.
3. Keep the most common values for each named component within a state.
4. Rescale so texture components add to 100%
5. Split components into 70% training and 30% test set stratified by state.

hzlist.train: 70% subset
hzlist.test: 30% subset
